                <h3 class="mb-4">FRIENDSHIP</h3>
                <p>Most of the people that come on our tours come by themselves. Our community is built on friendships that have been made on our trips, experiencing something life changing together, the shared memories and also goals to do more in the future! We encourage people not to be anxious about coming on these trips by yourself as we promise you will leave with some like minded friends and be really glad you made the decision to get out of your comfort zone and join in.</p>

                <h3 class="mb-4">BELONG</h3>
                <p>Our community is our backbone. We have had so many people start with no hiking experience, basic fitness and not knowing anyone on our trips. These same people have gone on to do some incredible multi day hiking trips with us and their friends they have met in our community. Witnessing the development of their fitness, confidence, experience, friendships and happiness is why we do what we do. Come join us and let us help you get from the couch to the top of the mountain!</p>

                <h3 class="mb-4">ADVENTURE</h3>
                <p>Experiences, not things. The moments that take your breath away. The feeling of accomplishment and the realisation that you are capable of so much more than what you thought. The views that blow your mind and the ticking off of bucket list items. We take all the hard work out of it for you. We organise the lot so you can just turn up and get the best of your experience without all the headaches of organising/logistics. We make it easy for you to do all the thing you want to do â€“ you just need to turn up and be ready to jump into life!</p>
